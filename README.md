RubiksCubeEmulator
==================

Description: 
A Window's Console application that emulates a Rubik's Cube.  

Features: 
User can interact with the cube through key strokes.  
User can specify arbirary cube size.
Cube can be randomized.
Cube can be reset.

To compile:
I built this code using Visual Studio 2010.  Create a new Console Application Project.  Add the face class files
(face.h & face.cpp) as well as the cube class files (cube.h & cube.cpp) and the driver (main.cpp).  

To Run:  
Either build the code and execute it with the IDE of your choice or run RubiksCube.exe (if you trust it).
